# Note Taker

## Description
This project is a note taker app that can be used to create and delete notes as well as save them and read saved notes. Note Taker uses an Express.js back end and saves/retrieves notes to/from a JSON file.

You can save notes by entering a title and text and then clicking the save icon in the top right. Clicking the + icon in the top right will create a new note. Saved notes can be accessed by clicking on them in the left panel, and can be deleted by clicking on the trash icon next to the note.

This app has been deployed to Heroku [here](https://intense-crag-47403.herokuapp.com/).
